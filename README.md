# COVID-2020
This repository is an attempt to analyze and predict Corona Virus cases world wide.

I am no virologist or an expert in Epidemology-- but a simple AI practioner. And so without going into any further details will directly divulge into the data and the insights it offers.

The number of confirmed cases as of today 18th March 2020 have crossed 2 Lakhs i,e: 2,00,000. The image below shows these cases and how they are distributed along the world.

The graph above makes it clear China had maximum cases, next in line is Europe it is still increasing, and then US... The picture is indeed appears grim.


We data scientists love 'normalization', it helps us to see things on different scales together. Here also, each country has different population so instead of absolute numbers of confirmed cases, it makes more sense to see the confirmed cases as percentage of each countries population. The graph is below
